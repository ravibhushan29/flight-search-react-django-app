# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Running the React Application

Follow these steps to run the React application locally:

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   First, open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend` folder within your project:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the required npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   Start the React development server on port 3000 by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3000
   ```

After completing these steps, the React application will be running on `http://localhost:3000` and you can view it in your web browser.
